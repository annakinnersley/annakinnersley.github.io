        <h1>How Tottenham can learn from Liverpool's second place finish</h1>
        <p>"I sat in the back of the car and felt the tears rolling down my face. I hadn't cried for years but, on the way home, I couldn't stop. The tears kept coming. I can't even tell you if the streets were thick with traffic or as empty as I was on the inside. It was killing me."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Steven Gerrard cried for hours that day because he knew Liverpool had blown his best chance of winning the Premier League title. And to make it worse for the skipper, it was Gerrard who had slipped two years ago today against Chelsea which meant Manchester City would go on to win the league. </br>

        </br> Tottenham haven't blown the title like the Reds did, it will hurt, but not as much as it would have hurt Gerrard who knew this was his last ever chance. Nevertheless, the Merseyside club made some big mistakes the following season and Spurs can learn from it. </p>
        <h4>KEEP HOLD OF BEST PLAYERS</h4>

<p>The biggest crime that Brendan Rodgers made was he sold his best player. In fairness to the northern Irishman, he didn't have much choice.</br>

</br>Luis Suarez was one of the best players in the world and belonged to one of the best teams in the world. Not a team that he dragged from seventh to second. </br>
</br>Not to mention the Uruguayan wanted to leave the previous summer to join Arsenal, but the captain at the time, Gerrard, persuaded him to play one more year in the hope Barcelona or Real Madrid would come calling the following season. And that's exactly what happened. </br>

</br>Now Tottenham don't have a Luis Suarez, but they do have some top players that some big European clubs might be interested in. </br>

</br>Harry Kane has scored more than 20 goals a season in consecutive campaigns and with top strikers few and far between now across Europe, European juggernauts will certainly be keeping an eye on him. </br>

</br>Dele Alli has just won the Young Player of the Year award and at 20-years-old, he has plenty of time to improve. </br>

</br>Toby Alderweireld, Eric Dier, and Christian Eriksen have all had impressive seasons and may be tempted by lucrative offers elsewhere. </br>

</br>Of course, Spurs are no strangers to selling their best players and don't necessarily need to learn from Liverpool in this situation they just need to learn from themselves. </br>

</br>While the likes of Erik Lamela, Eriksen, and Nacer Chadli have shown that they do have some value, Paulinho, Roberto Soldado, Etienne Capoue and Vlad Chiriches did not represent worthy Gareth Bale money. </br>

</br>It's not easy to keep a player like Bale, especially if you're not in the Champions League, but now they do have European football and the cash that comes with it, there's no reason to sell a Kane, an Alli, or an Eriksen cheaply. </br>

</br>The most important factor in all this, however, could be keeping hold of their manager and not necessarily the players. </br>

</br>Mauricio Pochettino, as quoted by Sky Sports, said: "I've always said that I would be pleased to join a great club like PSG. </br>

</br>"Come to Paris? I hope so. It is true that it would please me. It's part of my dreams. I try to watch all their matches, especially in the Champions League." </br>

</br>That's worrying for Spurs fans. Hopefully, for their sake, he's just trying to increase the monetary benefits of a new contract, but if he is thinking of moving, players like Eriksen might decide against signing a new contract and move with him. </br>

</br>Essentially, Pochettino is Tottenham's Luis Suarez and they must not let him get away. </p>
<h4>BUY SENSIBLY </h4>

<p>It sounds simple, but there is always a temptation to bulk buy when you've had a successful season. Daniel Levy might have dollar signs flashing in his eyes right now, but even he knows that splashing the cash recklessly isn't going to help. </br>

</br>The Bale money wasn't used effectively in most cases, even if a few have shown their ability this season. Now is the time to purchase in areas where they could be vulnerable. </br>

</br>The problem with what Liverpool did after they finished second two years ago, was that they tried to bulk a squad that needed quality in many areas. </br>
</br>Buying seven, eight or nine players isn't going to be easy to integrate. Pochettino proved last summer how building the team bit by bit can slowly make you great. </br>

</br>They need to do the same again, provide cover for Dier and Kane, purchase another attacking player who can compete with Alli, Eriksen or Lamela and maybe a centre-half. No more, though, buy some Champions League quality to keep the squad hungry, and don't unsettle them. </br>

</br>Levy needs to be confident now that Pochettino knows what he's doing. Trying to penny pinch over Saido Berahino last summer could have cost them dearly if Kane got injured. </br>

</br>Sign a centre forward early and let the Argentinian manager spend on the areas he needs to improve, otherwise, he might not stick around. </br>

</br>Spurs might have to be careful with their spending anyway with the new stadium being built so reckless spending shouldn't be a problem. </br>

</br>The main thing, however, is for the north London club to not feel too disappointed on missing out on the title and strive to go again. They weren't expected to win the league and they're not expected to next season. They should be motivated more than ever to go one better next year. </p>
